# Solana Ecosystem Landscape Theme Fixes

## Summary of Improvements

I've successfully fixed all theme-related issues in the Solana ecosystem landscape website. The application now has consistent, accessible, and visually appealing themes with proper transitions and persistence.

## Key Fixes Implemented

### 1. Theme Persistence
- Added localStorage support to remember user theme preferences across page refreshes
- Implemented proper theme initialization based on saved preferences or system defaults

### 2. CSS Variables System
- Created a comprehensive CSS variables system for all colors and design tokens
- Implemented proper theme class selectors (.theme-dark, .theme-light, .theme-blue)
- Ensured all components use these variables instead of hardcoded colors

### 3. Component-Level Improvements
- **Sidebar**: Fixed contrast issues, especially in Dark theme
- **ProjectCard**: Enhanced hover and focus states, improved accessibility
- **ProjectModal**: Corrected styling for consistent appearance across themes
- **ThemeToggle**: Added visual feedback and improved accessibility

### 4. UX Enhancements
- Added smooth transitions between themes for a polished experience
- Improved focus indicators for better keyboard navigation
- Standardized interactive element states (hover, focus, active)
- Fixed loading indicators to adapt to theme colors

### 5. Technical Improvements
- Resolved TypeScript errors related to CSS custom properties
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Enhanced accessibility through proper ARIA attributes and focus management

## Validation
All fixes have been thoroughly tested across:
- Dark theme
- Light theme
- Blue theme

The application now maintains consistent styling and proper contrast in all themes, with smooth transitions between them and proper persistence of user preferences.

## Next Steps
The theme system is now robust and can be easily extended with additional themes if needed in the future. The CSS variables approach makes it simple to adjust colors and maintain consistency across the application.
